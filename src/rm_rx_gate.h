// rm_rx_gate.h -- the one receive hook for remote-management DMs ("RM1 <ctr> ...", RM-04, #1189).
//
// Called for a DM to the exact own call, with the "{NNN" suffix already stripped, from every ingress:
// OnRxDone (LoRa) and the server ingress of a gateway node (udp_frame_esp32.cpp / udp_frame_nrf52.cpp).
//
// Since 2026-10-06 (RM-GWRELAY, operator decision) a COMMAND is accepted from either path, like a reply
// always was: the HMAC tag and the counter authenticate it wherever it travelled. The former "LoRa only"
// rule (RM-D6) keyed on the server flag, which a gateway also sets on every frame it relays over RF, so a
// node behind a gateway could not be managed at all. A frame that arrives on both paths is harmless: the
// second copy has the same counter and tag and gets the cached reply (rmCheck, RM_CACHED), nothing runs twice.
//
// Since 2026-10-07 (RM-DUP) the second copy of the SAME FRAME (same source, same message id, within 60 s) is
// (same text too) dropped here, before the queue: it is consumed and nothing else happens. Otherwise a wrong tag arriving
// on both paths was counted twice and one junk frame cost two strikes of the lockout.
//
// Header-only; needs rmIsReply() (remote_cmd.cpp) and the queues of rm_queue.h.
