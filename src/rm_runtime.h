// The protocol core (remote_cmd.h) only decides; this file drains the 2-slot queue that OnRxDone
// fills (rm_queue.h), runs the verified command through ONE literal console string from a fixed
// table (never the received text), persists the counter high-water mark, answers with a tagged
// DM and, for "reboot", restarts a few seconds after the reply was queued.
//
// Both entry points run in the loop task only (crypto, flash write and sendMessage() are not
// allowed in RX context).
